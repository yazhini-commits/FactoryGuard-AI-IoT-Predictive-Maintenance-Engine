Key values

Final f(x) ≈ 4.15 → Even higher risk than case 1

Feature impact

| Feature                  | SHAP value        |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| *pressure_x = 98.4*      | *+2.87 (highest)* |
| *temperature_x = 72.8*   | *+2.68*           |
| *vibration_x = 1.35*     | *+0.12*           |

Interpretation

This is a critical failure case

Pressure and temperature are both extremely high

Vibration slightly worsens the situation
