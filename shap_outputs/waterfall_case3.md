Interpretation

This is a critical failure case

Pressure and temperature are both extremely high

Vibration slightly worsens the situation

| *pressure_x = 99.4*      | *+1.61*      |
| *temperature_x = 64.2*   | *+0.52*      |
| *vibration_x = 0.85*     | *+0.04*      |

Interpretation

 Pressure is high, but temperature is moderate
So failure risk exists, but not extreme.
